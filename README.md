## Notes

1. Foundry uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage dependencies. For
   detailed instructions on working with dependencies, please refer to the
   [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html) in the book
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful when debugging and
   testing against a fork.
